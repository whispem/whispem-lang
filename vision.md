# Whispem — Vision

Whispem is an experimental programming language born from a desire to explore simplicity, clarity, and expressiveness in code.

This document describes the *intent* behind Whispem.  
It is not a specification, and it is not a promise of stability.  
It is a guiding vision.

## Why Whispem exists

Modern programming languages are powerful, but often complex.  
Whispem exists as a space to step back and ask simpler questions:

- What is the minimum needed to express an idea clearly?
- How much structure is enough — and when does it become noise?
- Can a language encourage calm, readable code?

Whispem is an exploration of these questions.

## Core values

### Clarity over cleverness

Code written in Whispem should favor readability and intent over trickery or obscure optimizations.

If something is hard to read, it is probably not Whispem.

---

### Fewer concepts, stronger foundations

Whispem aims to rely on a small number of core concepts that compose well together.

New features must justify their existence by:
- reducing overall complexity, or
- increasing expressive power without adding cognitive load.

---

### Expressiveness with restraint

Whispem values expressiveness, but not at the cost of clarity.

The goal is not to be terse for its own sake, but to allow ideas to be expressed naturally and directly.

---

### Explicit over implicit

Whenever possible, Whispem prefers explicit behavior to hidden magic.

The language should help the programmer understand *what happens*, not guess.

---

### Experimental by design

Whispem is intentionally experimental.

Breaking changes are acceptable.
Ideas may be introduced, refined, or removed.
The language is expected to evolve as understanding deepens.

---

## What Whispem is not

Whispem does **not** aim to:

- Replace existing mainstream languages
- Be the fastest language
- Solve every problem domain
- Achieve mass adoption quickly

Whispem values coherence over ambition.

---

## Intended use

Whispem is intended for:
- learning and experimentation
- language design exploration
- small tools or scripts
- expressing ideas clearly

Any real-world usage is a bonus, not a requirement.

---

## Long-term direction (tentative)

Over time, Whispem may explore:
- a small but expressive type system
- predictable semantics
- minimal runtime abstractions
- a simple and transparent execution model

These directions are exploratory, not commitments.

---

## A living document

This vision is expected to evolve.

As Whispem grows, this document may change to reflect new insights, constraints, or goals.
