# Whispem Vision

Whispem is not designed to compete with large general-purpose languages.

It is designed to be **understandable in its entirety**.

---

## Philosophy

Whispem values:

- Clarity over cleverness
- Explicitness over magic
- Calm readability
- Small, intentional feature sets

Every feature must earn its place.

---

## Why an interpreter?

Whispem is interpreted by design.

This allows:
- immediate feedback
- simple execution model
- easier experimentation
- full control over language semantics

Performance is not the primary goal.
Understanding is.

---

## Minimalism

Whispem avoids:

- implicit behavior
- hidden state
- complex syntax
- unnecessary abstractions

If something can be explained simply, it should be.

---

## Growth model

Whispem grows in **layers**:

1. Expressions
2. Variables
3. Control flow
4. Functions
5. Composition

Each layer must remain stable before the next is added.

---

## Audience

Whispem is for:

- people learning how languages work
- developers who value simplicity
- creators who enjoy small, elegant systems

---

## Long-term vision

Eventually, Whispem aims to be:

- self-hosted
- distributable as a standalone binary
- fully specified
- boring in the best possible way
