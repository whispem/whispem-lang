# Whispem — Vision

Whispem is a personal and experimental programming language.

Its purpose is not performance or adoption, but understanding how languages
are designed and executed.

---

## Principles

- Simplicity over power
- Explicit behavior
- Minimal syntax
- Learnability through implementation

---

## Direction

Whispem evolves incrementally.
Each version introduces a single, clear improvement.

The language is intentionally constrained so it can be fully understood
by reading its source code.
