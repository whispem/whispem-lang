# Whispem — Vision

Whispem is a personal and experimental programming language.

Its purpose is not performance, popularity, or completeness,
but understanding, intention, and clarity.

---

## Core Principles

### Simplicity over power

Whispem favors a small set of clear, understandable features over a large and
complex feature set.

---

### Explicit behavior

Code should do exactly what it appears to do.
There is no hidden behavior and no implicit magic.

---

### Minimal syntax

Every keyword and construct must have a clear reason to exist.
If a feature is not essential, it does not belong in the language.

---

### Learnability

Whispem is designed so that its entire implementation can be read and understood.
The language itself is part of the learning process.

---

## What Whispem Is Not

- Not a production-ready language
- Not optimized for performance
- Not designed to replace existing tools

---

## Direction

Whispem evolves slowly and deliberately.
Each new feature must preserve the language’s clarity and educational value.

Whispem is meant to remain small enough to fit entirely in its creator’s head.
