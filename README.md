# Whispem

**Whispem** is an experimental, open-source programming language created to explore ideas around simplicity, readability, and expressiveness.

Whispem is not intended (at least for now) to compete with existing languages. 
It is primarily a personal and technical exploration of programming language design.

---

## ✨ Philosophy

Whispem is guided by a small set of core principles:

- **Clarity first**: code should be easy to read and reason about.
- **Less, but better**: a small number of well-defined concepts.
- **Expressiveness**: say more with less.
- **Experimental by nature**: design decisions are not fixed and may evolve.
- **Intellectual enjoyment**: Whispem is also a creative project.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Design a simple and expressive syntax
- Explore language semantics and design trade-offs
- Implement a minimal interpreter or compiler
- Document technical and conceptual decisions

---

## 🚧 Project status

> ⚠️ **Work in progress**

Whispem is in a very early stage. 
Syntax, semantics, and implementation details may change frequently.

No stability guarantees are provided.

---

## 🧠 Inspirations (non-exhaustive)

Whispem draws inspiration from:
- Rust (clarity and rigor)
- Lua (simplicity)
- Lisp (expressiveness)
- Experimental languages and DSLs

---

## 🛠️ Implementation (tentative)

- Implementation language: *to be determined* (likely Rust)
- Parsing: *to be determined*
- Target: interpreter and/or compiled backend

All of these choices may evolve as the project grows.

## 🤍 Why this project exists

Whispem exists as a space to:
    •    explore how programming languages are designed
    
    •    understand the trade-offs behind design decisions
    
    •    learn by building

## 🌱 Contributing

Contributions are welcome, but the project remains experimental and primarily personal.
Thoughtful discussions and constructive feedback are appreciated.

Whispem is a language in progress. It whispers rather than shouts.
